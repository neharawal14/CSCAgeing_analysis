// Comparing run_F_final.txt => file with final list of events in ME12HV1
// with run_checking_F_input.txt => file with number of events in input dataset 

# It looks for the period 39 fb-1 39.5 fb-1 LHC delievered (2956+42027) = 44983 events , while 39.5 fb-1 - 40 fb-1 , LHC delievered (559963+28684+7175+328861)= 204321 events. This info is stored in te    xt file run_checking_F_input.txt                                                                                                                                                                        
  #While from these runs at last we obtain in ME12HV1 ;
# For (39-39.5 fb-1) = 5940+8241 = 14181 events  
  For (39.5-40 fb-1) = 128413 +7989+1369+66550 = 204321 events 
 I do not know why the input file has more events for the one delievered lumi period while has not for the other lumi period ?
